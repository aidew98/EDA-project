So an indepth study in this kind of dataset will help to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market.This project aims to leverage data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from Play Store app data, which can benefit both users and developers. This particular project has two data sets  to be analysed. First data set has 13 columns mainly includes diffrent app infomation, rating, size,version etc. and second data set has 5 columns and is basically covering customer reviews of the android apps. Explore and analyse the data to discover key factors responsible for app engagement and success."
